# Git Labyrinth

**Your GitHub activity awakens as a pixel hero in the dungeon.**

Every commit, every repository, every line of code shapes a character that represents your journey as a developer.

## How it Works

1. **Link Your GitHub** — Sign in with your GitHub account to begin your adventure. Your coding history becomes the foundation of your character.
2. **Characters Awaken** — Your repositories are analyzed and transformed into RPG characters. Each programming language determines your class, level, and abilities.
3. **Share Your Card** — Generate an OG image card featuring your pixel heroes and embed it in your GitHub README to showcase your developer identity.

## Job Classes

Each programming language forges a unique warrior. Your most-used languages determine which heroes join your party.

Your GitHub activity is converted into 5 RPG attributes, each scaled from 0 to 100.

| Stat | Source | Max Threshold |
|------|--------|---------------|
| **VIT** (Vitality) | Consecutive commit days | 365 days |
| **CHA** (Charisma) | GitHub followers | 1,000 |
